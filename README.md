# Online Payment Fraud Detection
This repository contains a machine-learning model for detecting frauds during online payments. The project includes model training, visualizing, and saving the trained model for future use.

## Project Overview
The project aims at developng a machine learning model for prediciting the possibilty of frauds during online transaction. It includes the following features :
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Splitting data into training and testing sets
3. Training the model on given dataset
4. Visualizing data for better understanding
5. Saving the trained model for future predictions

### Data
Dataset used in this project is Fraud_Detection_.csv

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world fraud detections. The machine learning model developed here is based on publicly available data from Kaggle and has been modified and trained to demonstrate classification techniques using Logistic Regression, and classifiers.
